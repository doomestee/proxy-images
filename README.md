This is an API that will fetch and cache any images per the user's request for a program. For now, the API is public for everybody with no rate-limits or anything...

I might not come back and maintain this repo though.

* TODO:
 * - [ ] Add ratelimits.
 * - [ ] Cache control
   * - [ ] Allows authorised requests to update an image.
   * - [ ] Allows authorised requests to flush the location.json file.
